# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Hotfix is a cross-platform (macOS + Windows + Linux) system tray app that monitors CPU usage and kills runaway processes before fans spin up. The macOS app is written in Swift/SwiftUI; the Windows and Linux apps are written in Go (two separate modules, `windows/` and `linux/`, that share no code).

## Build Commands

### macOS
```bash
# Full build → dist/Hotfix.app + dist/Hotfix.dmg
bash scripts/build.sh

# Swift compile only (no bundling)
swift build -c release --arch arm64 --arch x86_64

# Run directly from build output (no DMG needed)
open dist/Hotfix.app
```

### Windows
```powershell
cd windows
# Embed the flame icon + version metadata (writes resource.syso), then build.
# resource.syso is git-ignored; without `go generate` the local exe has no icon.
go generate ./...
go build -ldflags "-H windowsgui -s -w" -o ..\dist\Hotfix.exe .

# Per-user installer → dist/Hotfix-Setup.exe (needs Inno Setup 6 / ISCC.exe)
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" /DMyAppVersion=1.0.7 installer\hotfix.iss
```

> Icons live in `windows/assets/`: a theme-adaptive monochrome flame for the tray
> (`tray_white*.png` / `tray_black*.png`, mirroring the macOS menu-bar flame) and a
> colored `Hotfix.ico` for the .exe/installer. Regenerate all of them with
> `windows/assets/gen-icons.ps1` (PowerShell + .NET, no external deps).

### Linux
```bash
cd linux
go vet ./... && go test ./...
# Pure Go, static. Cross-compiles from any OS (set GOOS=linux; GOARCH=amd64|arm64).
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w" -o ../dist/hotfix .
```

> A plain build does **not** enforce the subscription (dev build). Enforcement is compiled in by `-ldflags "-X main.licensePublicKey=<base64>"`, which CI does from the repo variable `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY`; `hotfix --version` says "dev build" when it's absent.
>
> From a non-Linux machine, `GOOS=linux go vet ./...` type-checks the code **and** the tests, but the tests themselves only run on Linux (CI's `build-linux` job).

## Release Process

1. Bump the version in: `Sources/Hotfix/UpdateChecker.swift` (`currentVersion`), `Resources/Info.plist` (`CFBundleShortVersionString` **and** bump `CFBundleVersion`), `windows/updater.go` (`currentVersion`), `linux/updater.go` (`currentVersion`), and the hardcoded version label in `windows/assets/settings.html` (About card). `windows/main.go` only references `updater.go`'s `currentVersion`, so no literal there. (Version-comparison fixtures in `windows/updater_test.go` are not app versions — leave them.) The exe-metadata version in `windows/versioninfo.json` and the installer version are **stamped automatically** from the release tag by CI — don't bump them by hand. The site's **download buttons carry no version** — they point at the counting redirect (`hotfix.buildcraft.town/dl/{mac,win}`), which resolves the latest release asset at request time, so there's nothing to bump in `docs/index.html`.
2. Create a GitHub release tagged `v<version>` — the `Build` workflow runs automatically on `macos-latest`, `windows-2025`, and `ubuntu-latest`. Each release gets these version+OS-named assets: `Hotfix-v<version>-macOS.dmg`, `Hotfix-v<version>-Windows.exe` (the **raw exe**, downloaded by the in-place auto-updater), `Hotfix-Setup-v<version>-Windows.exe` (the **per-user installer**, what the website's Windows button links to), and for Linux, per CPU (`x86_64`, `arm64`), `Hotfix-v<version>-Linux-<arch>` (the **raw binary**, downloaded by the in-place auto-updater) and `Hotfix-v<version>-Linux-<arch>.tar.gz` (binary + `install.sh`/`uninstall.sh` + icon; what `/dl/linux` redirects to). There are no longer any plain `Hotfix.dmg` / `Hotfix.exe` assets. Pages serves `docs/` from `main`. (The legacy `update-site` CI job that rewrote versioned download URLs in `docs/index.html` is now a **no-op** — the buttons point at the version-less `/dl/*` redirect; see **Website & download counter** below.)
3. A user-facing feature is **not shipped** until this release is cut and the Build run succeeds with all assets attached — the website serves only released binaries.

> Logs: macOS → `~/Library/Logs/Hotfix/hotfix.log`; Windows → `%APPDATA%\Hotfix\hotfix.log`; Linux → `~/.local/state/hotfix/hotfix.log`. macOS and Windows surface it in Settings via an in-app log viewer; Linux opens it from the tray's "View Log". Desktop notifications fire on every successful kill (macOS notification center; Windows WinRT toast; Linux freedesktop notification over D-Bus).

## Architecture

### macOS (`Sources/Hotfix/`)

The app is a `MenuBarExtra`-only app (no Dock icon). Core objects are singletons shared via `@StateObject`:

- **`ProcessMonitor`** (`@MainActor` singleton) — 5-second `Timer` loop that reads process CPU via `ps`, tracks hot start times in a `[pid → TimeInterval]` dict, kills via `kill()`, and publishes `hotProcesses` / `isKilling` to the UI. Also listens for `NSWorkspace.willSleepNotification` to kill on sleep.
- **`PreferencesManager`** — Wraps `@AppStorage` for all settings (threshold, duration, kill-on-sleep, whitelist). Whitelist is stored as JSON in `UserDefaults`.
- **`UpdateChecker`** — Hits the GitHub releases API on launch; compares semver tags.
- **Open at Login** — The "Open at Login" toggle in Settings registers/unregisters Hotfix as a per-user login item via `SMAppService.mainApp` (`ServiceManagement`, macOS 13+ — no helper bundle or entitlement). `PreferencesManager.launchAtLogin` mirrors `SMAppService.mainApp.status` (the real source of truth) and is re-synced after every `setLaunchAtLogin(_:)` call, so the toggle reflects the actual system state even if registration is denied.
- **`SettingsWindowController`** / **`SettingsView`** — Native SwiftUI settings panel opened from the menu.
- **`MenuBarPopoverView`** — The popover shown when clicking the tray flame icon. Shows hot processes and quick toggles.
- **`Log`** (`Logger.swift`) — Thread-safe file logger (`logf("…")`) that appends to `~/Library/Logs/Hotfix/hotfix.log` (and stderr). Mirrors the Windows logger format. Desktop notifications use `UNUserNotificationCenter` (authorization requested at launch).
- **`CrashReporter`** (`CrashReporter.swift`) — Crash capture mirroring the Windows `crashreport.go`: an uncaught-`NSException` handler and async-signal-safe signal handlers (SIGSEGV/SIGABRT/SIGILL/SIGFPE/SIGBUS/SIGTRAP, covering Swift fatal-error traps) write a marker (`~/Library/Logs/Hotfix/lastcrash.txt`); on the next launch it opens a pre-filled, tokenless GitHub "New Issue" page and clears the marker. Armed in `HotfixApp.init`.

Safety exclusions (kernel_task, WindowServer, Finder, etc.) are hardcoded in `ProcessMonitor` and can never be overridden by user settings.

### Windows (`windows/`)

A single Go binary with `//go:build windows` on every file. No CGO; uses `github.com/getlantern/systray` for the system tray and `github.com/jchv/go-webview2` (pure Go, no CGO) for the settings window. It is **not** an Electron app, and runs **no local HTTP server / no open port**.

- **`main.go`** — Entry point: init logging, load config, hand control to `systray.Run`. Owns the tray icon: embeds the monochrome flame PNGs and picks white vs black at runtime from the `SystemUsesLightTheme` registry value (re-applied live when the user flips light/dark). The `//go:generate` directive here produces `resource.syso` (exe icon + version metadata) from `versioninfo.json` + `assets/Hotfix.ico`.
- **`monitor.go`** — 5-second poll loop using `wmic` CSV output. Tracks hot processes in `hotMap`, calls `taskkill /F` when threshold exceeded. Sleep detection via a PowerShell WMI event subscription.
- **`config.go`** — Reads/writes JSON config from `%APPDATA%\Hotfix\config.json`. Thread-safe via `sync.RWMutex`.
- **`startup.go`** — The "Run at Startup" toggle. Adds/removes a per-user autostart entry under the `HKCU\...\CurrentVersion\Run` key (no admin/UAC), pointing at the running exe (quoted). Uses `golang.org/x/sys/windows/registry` (already a transitive dep). The **registry is the source of truth**: `loadConfig` overwrites `Config.LaunchAtLogin` from the live registry on every load, so the toggle reflects reality even when the installer's `[Tasks] startupicon` (which writes the same value) or the user changed it outside the app. `applySavedConfig` applies the toggle non-fatally — a failure just self-corrects on the next load.
- **`settings_window.go`** — The settings UI: a **WebView2 popover** opened from the tray's "Settings…" item. Loads the embedded `assets/settings.html` directly (`SetHtml`) into a frameless, top-most window anchored at the work-area bottom-right (by the tray), and dismisses on click-away. The page calls Go directly through WebView2 **native bindings** (`hotfixGetConfig` / `hotfixSaveConfig` / `hotfixGetLog` / `hotfixCheckUpdates` / `hotfixOpenLog`) — there is no HTTP server. Save validation + monitor start/stop live in `applySavedConfig`. Runs on a dedicated locked OS thread. If the WebView2 runtime is missing (rare on Win11), it toasts and opens the runtime download page.
- **`updater.go`** — Silent background self-update (mirrors the macOS updater): polls the GitHub releases API ~30s after launch and every 6h, downloads the **raw** `Hotfix-v…-Windows.exe` asset (`pickRawExeURL` skips the `Hotfix-Setup-*` installer), swaps it onto the running exe via a hidden PowerShell, and relaunches — no prompts. This works without elevation because the app installs **per-user** under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Hotfix`.
- **`installer/hotfix.iss`** — Inno Setup script for the per-user installer (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest` → installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Hotfix`, no admin/UAC). Adds a Start-Menu shortcut, an optional run-at-login entry (the `[Tasks] startupicon` — writes the **same** `HKCU\...\Run` value the in-app "Run at Startup" toggle manages; see `startup.go`), and a proper uninstaller in "Apps & features". The downloaded `Hotfix-Setup-*.exe` is freely deletable after install.
- **`notify.go`** — Desktop toast notifications via hidden PowerShell (WinRT `Windows.UI.Notifications` toast, with a `NotifyIcon` balloon-tip fallback). Title/body are passed through env vars to avoid quoting/injection. Called from `notifyKilled` in addition to the tray-label update. File logging is handled by `initLog`/`logf` in `main.go` (writes to `%APPDATA%\Hotfix\hotfix.log`).

All console-spawning child processes (`wmic`, `taskkill`, `powershell`) use `HideWindow: true` in `SysProcAttr` to prevent flash windows (since the binary is built with `-H windowsgui`).

### Linux (`linux/`)

A single **pure-Go, CGO-free static binary** with `//go:build linux` on every file (its own module, `linux/go.mod`). Tray via `fyne.io/systray` (StatusNotifierItem over D-Bus — no GTK/AppIndicator libraries); D-Bus via `github.com/godbus/dbus/v5`. Keeping it CGO-free is deliberate: it is what lets one binary run on every distro and lets the updater swap a single file. That rules out an embedded webview, so there is **no settings window — the tray menu is the settings UI**.

- **`main.go`** — Entry point (`--version` flag, single-instance `flock` on `hotfix.lock`), the tray menu, and config application. Toggles are checkbox items; CPU Threshold / Kill After are submenus of presets (the current value is shown in the parent label, so a hand-edited non-preset value is still visible). `updateConfig` → `applyConfig` (validate, autostart, save) → `applyRuntime` (start/stop monitor, `syncMenu`).
- **`monitor.go`** — 5-second poll loop. `evaluate` (pure, unit-tested) applies the threshold, exclusions and hot-duration tracking in `hotMap`; `killProcess` sends `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` after 3s if the same process (PID + start time) is still alive. Only processes owned by the current user are candidates (unless root). Exclusions match both the kernel task name (truncated to 15 chars) and the executable's file name.
- **`procstat.go`** — Reads `/proc/<pid>/stat` directly (no `ps`). CPU% is the utime+stime delta between two polls, as a percent of **one core** (like `top`; can exceed 100). The first poll only records a baseline.
- **`config.go`** — JSON config at `~/.config/hotfix/config.json` (same keys as Windows). Missing keys keep defaults. Saves are atomic; `watchConfigFile` polls the mtime and **reloads on external edits** — this is how the whitelist is edited ("Edit Config File…" opens it via `xdg-open`). A malformed file is ignored, never replaced by defaults.
- **`startup.go`** — "Start at Login" = an XDG autostart entry (`~/.config/autostart/hotfix.desktop`) pointing at the running binary. The **file is the source of truth** (same pattern as the Windows Run key): `readConfigFile` overwrites `LaunchAtLogin` from it, and `install.sh --autostart` writes the same file.
- **`foreground.go`** — "Protect Active App", best-effort: `hyprctl` (Hyprland), `swaymsg` (sway), `xdotool`/`xprop` (X11/XWayland). GNOME/KDE Wayland expose no focused-window query, so it returns 0 there (logged once).
- **`sleep.go`** — Kill-on-sleep via systemd-logind's `PrepareForSleep` signal, holding a `delay` inhibitor lock so the kills are sent before suspend. On resume the hot map and CPU baseline are reset.
- **`notify.go`** — `org.freedesktop.Notifications.Notify` on the session bus (no `notify-send` dependency).
- **`updater.go`** — Same polling schedule as Windows. Downloads the raw `Hotfix-v…-Linux-<arch>` asset (`pickRawBinaryURL` skips the `.tar.gz`), checks the ELF magic, renames it over the running executable and re-`exec`s. If the install directory isn't writable (not a per-user install) it skips the self-update.
- **`license.go`** — **Subscription gate ($1/month, one machine).** `machineFingerprint` = HMAC-SHA256 keyed by `/etc/machine-id` (fallback `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id`) — the raw ID never leaves the machine. `refreshLicense` GETs `/license/verify?fp=…` and verifies the Ed25519-signed token (`parseLicenseToken`: signature, fingerprint match, expiry) against the public key stamped in at build time. Active → token cached in `~/.local/state/hotfix/license.token` (72h offline grace); inactive → cache cleared and the app locks: `applyRuntime` never starts the monitor unless `licensed()`, settings items are greyed out, and the tray shows **Subscribe ($1/month)…** / **Refresh License** (opens `/license/checkout?fp=…` in the browser, then polls every 10s for 15 min). Re-verified every 6h. **No Stripe key and no private key is ever in the client.** A build with an empty `licensePublicKey` doesn't enforce (local dev); CI refuses to release one.
- **`crashreport.go`**, **`log.go`** — Ports of the Windows crash marker / pre-filled GitHub issue flow and the rotating file logger. State (log, `lastcrash.txt`, lock) lives in `~/.local/state/hotfix/`.
- **`packaging/install.sh`** / **`uninstall.sh`** — Per-user install to `~/.local/bin/hotfix` plus an app-menu `.desktop` entry and icon (`icon/AppIcon.svg`, bundled as `hotfix.svg` by CI). No root.

### Website & download counter (`docs/`, `worker/`)

The marketing site lives in `docs/` (served by GitHub Pages from `main` at `hotfix.buildcraft.town`). Its Download buttons point at **`hotfix.buildcraft.town/dl/mac`** and **`/dl/win`** and **`/dl/linux`** (the Worker also serves **`/dl/linux-arm64`**, linked from the download note), handled by a Cloudflare Worker in `worker/` (`worker/src/worker.js`, config `worker/wrangler.toml`):

- On each hit it increments a per-platform counter in **Workers KV** (`count:{mac,win}` lifetime totals plus `count:{platform}:YYYY-MM-DD` daily buckets), then **302-redirects to the latest release asset**, resolved live from the GitHub releases API (cached ~300s). So the buttons never need per-release version bumps.
- The app's **silent auto-updater fetches release assets directly and never hits `/dl`**, so these counts approximate **fresh installs**, kept separate from update traffic. It's a fuzzy proxy: it can't tell a new user from a re-download, and KV's eventual consistency can drop the odd concurrent increment.
- **Licensing API (`worker/src/license.js`, routes `/license/*`)** — backend for the Linux subscription. `verify` returns an Ed25519-signed status token for a machine fingerprint; `checkout` creates a Stripe Checkout Session (subscription, $1/month inline price or `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`) with the fingerprint in `client_reference_id` + subscription metadata; `success` activates right after payment; `webhook` (HMAC signature-verified, 5-min tolerance) tracks `customer.subscription.*` so renewals/cancellations flip the KV record `lic:<fp>` in the separate `HOTFIX_LICENSE` namespace; `portal` opens Stripe's billing portal. Secrets `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `LICENSE_SIGNING_KEY` are `wrangler secret`s — never committed, never in the app. The token format is mirrored in `linux/license.go` and pinned by a cross-language fixture test. Tests: `node --test worker/test/license.test.mjs` (no deps; also run by CI's `build-linux` job). Setup steps are in `worker/README.md`.
- **`GET /dl/stats?key=<STATS_TOKEN>`** returns the counters as JSON. `STATS_TOKEN` (and an optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` for higher GitHub-API limits) are Cloudflare **secrets** set via `wrangler secret put` — never committed.
- Deploy with `wrangler deploy` from `worker/` (see `worker/README.md`). **The Worker must be deployed with licensing configured before a Linux release ships**, or every Linux user is locked out. Requires `buildcraft.town` DNS proxied through Cloudflare so the `/dl/*` route intercepts before Pages.

## Key Constraints

- **Tests** — Go unit tests live in `windows/*_test.go` (build-tagged `//go:build windows`). They run on the Windows CI runner via `go test ./...`. Swift tests run via `swift test` on the macOS runner. There is no way to execute the Windows tests locally on macOS. The Linux tests live in `linux/*_test.go` (build-tagged `//go:build linux`) and run on the Ubuntu CI runner; they can't be executed on Windows or macOS either.
- **Version must be bumped in multiple files** — forgetting one will cause the update checker to behave incorrectly or CI to produce a mismatched binary.
- macOS binary is **not notarized**; users must right-click → Open on first launch.
- Windows build sets `-H windowsgui`, so `fmt.Print` / `log` output goes nowhere — use the file logger (`initLog` / `logf`).
